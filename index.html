    <title>Mehmet BAKAY'S CV</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am Mehmet Bakay, born in 1999 in Mardin. I completed my secondary and high school education in Mardin. I have always had a continuous interest in applied subjects such as visual arts and technology design, and many of my works in these fields have been deemed worthy of exhibition in galleries. Ultimately, this interest led me to pursue architecture in college. Since my early years, I have been aiming to solidify my existing drawing and design skills with a strong foundation of knowledge and produce living works of art. Four of my projects during university have also been deemed worthy of exhibition. In addition to my university education, I strive to participate in various workshops and competitions to contribute to my development.</p>
